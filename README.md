Watched this hapi tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW3IAVOUFMg and coded along with Nic Raboy to learn more about Hapi
There were 2 instances where I need to research documentation in order for my code to work
Learned more about routes with "GET" and "POST"
Learned about Joi and how it helps with validation by setting up different parameters
